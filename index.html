    <p><strong>Characteristics of a mature profession:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Formal education and accreditation:</strong> Ensures members have the necessary knowledge and skills.</li>
<li><strong>Skills development and certification:</strong> Provides practical experience and verifies competence.</li>
<li><strong>Licensing:</strong> Grants legal right to practice and protects the public.</li>
<li><strong>Professional development:</strong> Ensures members stay up-to-date with changes in the field.</li>
<li><strong>Code of ethics:</strong> Promotes ethical behavior and protects public trust.</li>
<li><strong>Professional society:</strong> Represents the profession and supports its members.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Computer-related careers compared to mature professions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of mandatory certification and licensing:</strong> Anyone can write code or manage networks, potentially harming the public.</li>
<li><strong>Less emphasis on formal education and mentorship:</strong> Entry barriers are lower, but quality and ethics may be inconsistent.</li>
<li><strong>Shared responsibility within teams:</strong> Individual accountability for ethical decisions is harder to determine.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Case study: Certified Public Accountant (CPA)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Requires specific education, experience, and passing an exam for certification.</li>
<li>Maintains certification through continuing education and ethical compliance.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Software Engineer licensing attempt:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Failed due to low participation, suggesting limited value or industry readiness.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Importance of personal responsibility in computer-related careers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ethical decision-making skills are crucial due to the potential for harm.</li>
<li>Apply ethical theories and professional codes to guide your actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sure! Here are the important points of the document:</p>
<ul>
<li>A fully developed profession has a well-organized infrastructure for certifying new members and supporting those who already belong to the profession. The eight components of a mature professional infrastructure are initial professional education, accreditation, skills development, certification, licensing, professional development, code of ethics, and professional society.</li>
<li>When the public can trust the competence and integrity of the members of a profession, every one of its members benefits. For this reason professionals have a stake in ensuring that fellow members of the profession are capable and act appropriately. For mature professions, professional societies establish codes of ethics and require their members to keep their knowledge current through continuing education and training. Professionals who do not follow the code of ethics or fail to keep up with changes in the field can lose their licenses.</li>
<li>A crucial difference between computer-related careers and mature professions is certification and licensing. Certification and licensing allow a profession to determine who will be allowed to practice the profession. For example, a person may not practice law in a state without passing the bar exam and being granted a license. In contrast, people may write computer programs and maintain computer systems, either as consultants, sole proprietors, or members of larger firms, without being certified or having been granted a license.</li>
<li>The vast majority of people who hold computer-related jobs do not belong to either of computing&#39;s professional societies. It is up to particular employers to monitor the behavior of their employees and guide their continuing education—no professional organization has the authority to forbid someone from managing computer networks or writing computer programs.</li>
<li>In another important respect computer programmers differ from most professionals, such as dentists and ministers. Typically, professionals work directly with individual clients. A dentist treats one patient at a time. An accountant audits one business at a time. Most computer programmers work inside a company as part of a team that includes many other programmers as well as managers. In this environment the responsibility of an individual person is difficult to discern. Low-level technical decisions are made by groups, and final authority rests with management.</li>
<li>The computing &quot;profession&quot; may not be as well developed as the medical or legal professions, but in one key respect—the ability to harm members of the public—those who design, implement, and maintain computer hardware and software systems sometimes hold responsibilities similar to those held by members of mature professions. The Therac-25 killed or gravely injured at least six people, in part because of defective software. While most software engineers do not write code for safety-critical systems such as linear accelerators or self-driving automobiles, society does depend on the quality of their work. People make important business decisions based on the results they get from their spreadsheet programs. Millions rely upon commercial software to help them produce their income-tax returns. Errors in programs can result in such harms as lost time, incorrect business decisions, and fines. System administrators are responsible for keeping computer systems running reliably without infringing on the privacy of the computer users.</li>
<li>The ability to cause harm to members of the public is a powerful reason why those in computer-related careers must act according to ethical principles. Without formal certification and licensing and other components of a well-developed profession to rely upon, those in computer-related careers must take more personal responsibility for developing their ethical decision-making skills.</li>

<p><strong>The Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice: Key Points</strong></p>
<p>The Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice outlines eight principles that software engineers should follow to ensure their work benefits society and adheres to ethical standards. These principles cover various aspects of a software engineer&#39;s work, including:</p>
<p><strong>Public Interest:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Act in the public interest, prioritizing safety, quality of life, privacy, and environmental well-being.</li>

<p><strong>Key Points of Section 9.4: Analysis of the Code</strong></p>
<p><strong>Traditional vs. Alternative Principles:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The code expresses principles as what software engineers &quot;ought to do.&quot;</li>
<li>An alternative list focuses on general virtues applicable to any profession.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Alternative List of Fundamental Principles:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Impartiality:</strong> Prioritize public good over personal or organizational interests.</li>
<li><strong>Disclosure:</strong> Share necessary information and avoid deception.</li>
<li><strong>Respect:</strong> Respect the rights of others, including privacy, property, and intellectual property.</li>
<li><strong>Justice:</strong> Treat everyone fairly, ensuring fair wages, credit, and non-discrimination.</li>
<li><strong>Responsibility:</strong> Take responsibility for your actions and inactions, and supervise effectively.</li>
<li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Honor commitments, be loyal, obey laws, and avoid asking others to do unethical things.</li>
<li><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> Enhance your skills and ethical understanding.</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge Sharing:</strong> Contribute to worthy causes and educate others about software engineering and ethics.</li>
</ol>
